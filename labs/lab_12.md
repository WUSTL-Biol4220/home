# Lab 12

*Lab 12 GitHub Classroom link:* TBD

In this lab, we'll learn how assemble genomes using different software and techniques

1. Genome assembly with short read data against reference
2. De novo genome assembly with short read data
3. De novo genome assembly with long read data

This lab is written to be performed through RIS WUSTL, our university's cluster. Review Lab 11 for a refresher on how to use RIS WUSTL.
