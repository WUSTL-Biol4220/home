## Phylogenetics pipeline project

### Examples of organisms and genes:
- SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Influenza, Zika and various genes related to pathogenicity
- Primates and genes related to speech, brain development
- Hummingbirds, salamanders, and random loci related to population genetics
- Bovids and horn evolution (cows and relatives)
- Plants and mammals, and major relationships among lineages

### Examples of custom features:
- Compare phylogenetic differences among estimates from different methods
- Compare phylogenies between genes of interest and background genes (e.g. look for "fast-evolving" genes)
- Thoughtful input/output filesystem handling and organization
- Visualize samples on geographic map
- Visualize genetic relatedness using heatmaps
- Outputting results as nicely formatted Excel spreadsheet
- Segmenting genome into relevant structural genes
- Visualize timing and location of genetic samples of virus
- Histogram of sequence length among Genbank accessions for species/gene of interest
- Heatmap of interactions between virus and host species among Genbank accessions
- Historical biogeography of the clade
